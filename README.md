# CS 416: Narrative Visualization

## Extreme Weather effects on the Western States Endurance Run

This narrative visualization analyzes how climate change can impact day-to-day
activities. In this case, using the data from the Western States 100 Endurance
run, one of the most prestigious hundred miles races in the US.

The data from the study comes from official data provided by the race
organization, and weather data is integrated by crossing the published weather
data with the splits from the race. The data is originally split on a
year-by-year basis in the proprietary Excel format. Therefore, to be able to
use the data for the visualization, first I did the data cleaning, and curation
to export is as a single CSV file.

The visualization is available at [https://ivan.vc/wser](https://ivan.vc/wser).

The compiled data is available at [https://github.com/ivanvc/wser/blob/main/data/ws100.csv](https://github.com/ivanvc/wser/blob/main/data/ws100.csv).
