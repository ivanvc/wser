            We will start by analyzing the finish times across all years in the dataset for both genders.
            </p>

            <p>
            We can do the following observations. First, the race wasn't held in 2020 due to the COVID-19 pandemic, so there's no data for that year. Second, the female group is underrepresented. Therefore, we will focus the rest of the analysis on males.
            </p>

            <p>
            Finally, we can see that the distribution of the data is bimodal. The explanation is that we have different groups of runners; first, the elite runners, the minority of the field, making it a long tail on the left, usually finishing under twenty hours. Then, the rest of the field is the amateur runners, with the first group trying to run a hundred miles under twenty-four hours (we will refer to them as the sub-24 hour runners). These two groups make the first right-skewed normal distribution. After that, we see the runners that just want to finish within the race limit of thirty hours. This group makes the second right-skewed normal distribution.

            Now, we will analyze the finish time vs. the overall place.
            </p>

            <p>
            We can immediately notice that finishing times are impacted when the temperature increases, and it's also evident that the best overall times are with the lowest temperature.
            </p>

            <p>
            </p>With extreme weather conditions, in other words, as the temperature difference is more significant, we can see that the finishing times are affected but not significantly, with the most considerable difference right in the middle. However, 2021, when the difference is enormous (28°F), has the worst overall performance.

            <p>
            We can observe that even though the finish time is affected by the heat, previous runners' finish time impacts their finish time, as 2013, which is the warmest, doesn't have the worst overall finish times.

            Finally, we will analyze the dataset's finish rate across the different years.
            </p>

            <p>
            Again, we compare the temperature conditions and notice that the warmer it gets, the worst the success rate of finishing the race. And we see that with minimal temperature difference, the odds of finishing are greater, except for an outlier in 2015.
            </p>

            <p>
            As we previously discussed, a significant number of runners aim to finish in less than 24 hours. We see that the lower the highest temperature is, the better the performance and the odds of achieving the goal. This affirmation is considerably more remarkable for the females of the race.
            </p>

            <p>
            Across the different slides of this analysis, we notice that the vast majority of the participants are males. They drive the overall charts. Selecting and analyzing the females in this visualization sheds a different story, with the best sub-24-hour success in 2015, the year with the lowest temperature.
